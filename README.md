# MemSQL
MemSQL is an in-memory storage which support SQL-like query. Users can use different conditions to locate their data.

The MemSQL support `INSERT`,`QUERY`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT` and implement index search using hash map;

In next version, I will also add B-tree based index to simplify the operations when inserting data.
